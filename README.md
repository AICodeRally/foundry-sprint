# AI Code Rally — Foundry Sprint

**One command. Then start building.**

## Quick Start (Recommended)

Open your terminal and run:

```
npx @aicoderally/foundry-sprint
```

This will:
1. Download the starter project
2. Install dependencies
3. Start your app on http://localhost:3000
4. Launch Claude Code — your AI builder

**Prerequisites:**
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
- An Anthropic API key — set it before running:
  ```
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
  ```

## Alternative: GitHub Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/AICodeRally/foundry-sprint?quickstart=1)

Click the badge to launch a cloud environment with everything pre-configured.

## How It Works

1. Run the command above (or open a Codespace)
2. Tell Claude what you want to build
3. Check http://localhost:3000 to see your app
4. Keep iterating — describe changes, Claude builds them

**Example things to say:**
- "Build me a study planner for biology majors"
- "Make an app that generates resume bullet points from job descriptions"
- "I want an AI that summarizes legal contracts into plain English"

Claude writes all the code. You just describe what you want.

## Competition Tracks

- **Campus AI** — Apps for students, faculty, or campus life
- **Startup AI** — Apps that could become a real product
- **Replace the Intern** — Apps that automate tedious work

## Demo Day

- 3-minute live demo
- Your app must produce real AI responses
- Be ready to explain what your app does and why you chose this problem

## Tips

1. **Be specific.** "Study planner for biology majors" beats "AI helper"
2. **Iterate.** Ask Claude to change things until it feels right
3. **Check localhost:3000** after every change to see what happened
4. **Practice your pitch.** Ask Claude to help you prepare for demo day

## Need Help?

Type `claude` in the terminal. It already knows about your project.
