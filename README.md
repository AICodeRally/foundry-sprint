# AI Code Rally — Foundry Sprint

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/AICodeRally/foundry-sprint?quickstart=1)

**Click the badge above. That's it.**

Your Codespace will open with:
- A **terminal** where you talk to Claude (your AI builder)
- A **preview panel** where you see your app

## How It Works

1. Click the badge to launch your Codespace
2. Wait about 60 seconds for setup
3. Type `claude` in the terminal
4. Tell Claude what you want to build

**Example things to say:**
- "Build me a study planner for biology majors"
- "Make an app that generates resume bullet points from job descriptions"
- "I want an AI that summarizes legal contracts into plain English"

Claude writes all the code. You just describe what you want.

## Competition Tracks

- **Campus AI** — Apps for students, faculty, or campus life
- **Startup AI** — Apps that could become a real product
- **Replace the Intern** — Apps that automate tedious work

## Demo Day

- 3-minute live demo
- Your app must produce real AI responses
- Be ready to explain what your app does and why you chose this problem

## Tips

1. **Be specific.** "Study planner for biology majors" beats "AI helper"
2. **Iterate.** Ask Claude to change things until it feels right
3. **Check the preview** after every change to see what happened
4. **Practice your pitch.** Ask Claude to help you prepare for demo day

## Need Help?

Type `claude` in the terminal. It already knows about your project.
